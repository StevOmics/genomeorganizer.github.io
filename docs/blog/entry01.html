          <div class="text-left font-weight-normal" style="color:black">

            <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; It is a new year, and I have decided that it is time for me to make some&nbsp;genomic predictions for the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found myself telling these predictions to so many people that I talk to, that I thought it might be useful to just put them down for all to see.&nbsp; For some, these predictions may appear bold to the general public, and obvious to the research community,&nbsp;and this fact is representative of just how far ahead&nbsp;of the public discourse genome sequencing has gotten.&nbsp; <br />
                &nbsp; If you decide to have a child within the next five years, there is a good chance that you will decide that it is worthwhile to sequence his or her genome.&nbsp; Sequencing technology has advanced at a staggering rate within the past decade.&nbsp; This advance has been lead by next generation sequencing methodologies such as Roche's 454 platform, Life Technolgies' SOLID platform and Illumina's Solexa platform as well as less mature technologies such as Helicos and Ion Torrent.&nbsp; The steady improvement of these methods mean that it is now possible to sequence 2-4 human genomes on a single sequencing run of about four days, for&nbsp;a cost of around $10,000 per genome (including reagents, people time, etc.), and for those who aren't aware of this,&nbsp;your whole genome will fit on a USB thumb drive with plenty of room to spare.&nbsp; With each improvement in methodologies, this figure is getting closer to the critical number of $3,000.&nbsp; This figure is the approximate amount that a fertility clinic charges to expecting parents to conduct prenatal genetic screening, in which they use karyotyping and PCR-based methods to look for specific abnormalities in DNA samples from developing fetal tissue.&nbsp; When the cost of genome sequencing approaches this threshold, many parents will opt to sequence their childrens' genomes.&nbsp; <br />
                &nbsp; Whole genome sequencing offers the potential advantage of searching for every known genetic disorder, as opposed to running individual tests, one at a time.&nbsp; With all the sequence information, any potential harmful variant could be tested for.&nbsp; This includes variants that are known right now, as well as any genetic variant that is found during the lifespan of your child.&nbsp; As your child enters middle age, he or she will know whether they should really have annual colonoscopies to check for colon cancer, by searching for the most recently published polymorphisms associated with this disease, for instance.&nbsp; In addition, whole genome sequence information makes it possible to perform more complex genetic tests, such as those that look at more than one variant across the genome.&nbsp; Potentially, thousands of variants could be included in a single test for a complex disease.&nbsp; At the other end of the spectrum, whole genome information could be used for extremely simple tests, such as sex or blood type.&nbsp; In the future, if someone shows up at the emergency room and needs a blood transfusion, the nurse might as easily get their blood type by searching&nbsp;their genome as by drawing blood.<br />
                &nbsp; There is no question of whether we will start sequencing our children's' genomes; the only question is when.&nbsp; That being said, there are some disturbing aspects to the new reality that this technology will create for us.&nbsp; First, there is the question of what we do with this information.&nbsp; Most parents use genetic tests to screen children for disorders and avoid the possibility of complications of having a child with a serious or fatal disease.&nbsp; When there is essentially no incremental cost of screening for additional disease variants with varying predictive ability, what new ethical quandaries will present themselves to these parents?&nbsp; Second, whole genome sequence data is inherently non-anonymous.&nbsp; Your genome sequence doesn't have your initials written on it, but it does contain sufficient information to link it to standard genetic identity tests.&nbsp; In other words, if you posted your genome sequence anonymously on the Internet, I would be able to prove that it was indeed your genome sequence with a cheek swab and a PCR test.&nbsp; This leads to the third quandary, which is that it is hard to control the way in which one genome or many genomes together are used.&nbsp; How can&nbsp;we really guarantee that insurance companies, employers and other organizations with a vested interest in our future health will not use our genome sequences to discriminate against us in some way?<br />
                &nbsp; The solutions to these quandaries are not obvious.&nbsp; Clearly, the public needs more information and we must start the process of public debate on some level so that we as a society may decide how we want to use this information.&nbsp; The inevitable deluge of genomic information will result in many positive outcomes.&nbsp; The number of genetic tests that we currently have at our disposal is extremely limited, in large part due to the fact that most inherited traits are complex in nature, determined by contributions from many different genes.&nbsp; How many more tests will we have at our disposal when we have sequenced hundreds or even thousands of human genomes?&nbsp; What opportunities will this create for us to find new cures for diseases, as well as learn more about ourselves as a species?&nbsp; With this hopeful attitude in mind, and at the beginning of a new decade of science, I offer a call for rational debate, to provide us with a clear path for the future of our society at large.</div>
