          <div class="text-left font-weight-normal" style="color:black">

            <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">There is a new kind of scientific revolution happening right now in many fields of Biology and it is being caused not from any novel theory or "paradigm shift", but rather from a deluge of data.&nbsp; This wealth of data has not only given us a new set of tools with which to study existing problems, but has redefined old problems and generated new ones.&nbsp; This is mediating a new set of opportunities and challenges as we move forward.&nbsp; <br />
                <b>What's New?</b><br />
                We have been talking about "omics" for the last decade or so in various forms.&nbsp; Now, we are approaching the sequencing of the thousandth human genome.&nbsp; It is likely that by the end of the decade, we will have exceeded 100,000 genomes.&nbsp; The current cost of a genome is around $10,000, depending on the way in which it is done (if there's a sale, for instance), and this is rapidly dropping.&nbsp; The genomes we sequence now are used very differently from the first (composite) human genome, finalized in 2003.&nbsp; The thousand genomes project (link) is nearing completion, and an increasing number of individuals are having their genomes sequenced ().&nbsp; Several genome sequencing projects have been initiated for diagnostic purposes, and some patients with rare forms of cancer or hereditary disorders are opting to have their genomes sequenced for diagnostic purposes.&nbsp; These genomes are not being placed on the same pedestal as the first one, which has served as the focal point of countless studies, technologies and even a few educational tools.&nbsp; Many of these genomes are now sequenced with a specific purpose in mind.&nbsp; <br />
                <b> Genome Data Mining</b><br />
                For a long time, it has been possible to publish really good Biological studies without the need for much original data.&nbsp; Some amount of experimental data is usually necessary, owing to the fact that Biological systems are noisy, and findings need to be confirmed.&nbsp; However, the amount of genomic data available now is causing a shift in emphasis from data collection to data analysis.&nbsp; Increasingly, the key discovery in a study will be derived from genomic data.&nbsp; In the future, the heavy lifting for most studies will be done in the form of recruiting test subjects and analyzing their genomic data.&nbsp; The actual process of extracting DNA, sequencing it and following up on discoveries can be pretty much farmed out to fee-for-service Biological companies.&nbsp; While experimental biologists will continue to play an important role in basic research and development of new methodologies, it will be increasingly possible to carry out whole-genome studies without their direct involvement.<br />
                <b>The Age of Bioinformatics</b><br />
                Bioinformatics has had a natural progression into a preeminent position in Biology over the past decade.&nbsp; As it matures, I would predict two major trends in its development: Independence and Specialization.&nbsp; Up until now, Bioinformaticists have primarily played the role of analyzing data sets for other Biologists, in some way.&nbsp; As the Experimental Biologists developed new methodologies and applied them, they needed the support of Bioinformaticists in analyzing these data sets.&nbsp; As these data sets accumulated and the methodologies have matured, it has become increasingly possible for Computational Biologists to interpret data on their own, and verify them independently.&nbsp; However, in many cases they still required close collaboration with Experimental Biologists to do this.&nbsp; Many people (including me), have performed both roles for themselves.&nbsp; <br />
                Genomic data is fundamentally different, in that it stands on its own, independent of experimental methodology.&nbsp; Unlike gene expression data, genomes really don't change over time, making it possible to sequence once and analyze later.&nbsp; With medical histories in hand, and 3 gigabases in each data point, it is possible to make genomic analysis a full-time job.&nbsp; The follow-up can be aided by the standardization of experimental methodologies, allowing an increasing amount of follow up work to be done by untrained people.&nbsp; <br />
                I also predict that there will be a natural course of specialization in this new breed of Biologist, reflecting the innate complexity in the systems that they study.&nbsp; It is common now for medical researchers to be experts in physiology, but novices in computational biology.&nbsp; In the future, I think this will no longer be accepted, and the ability to interpret genomic data at some level will be an expected skill.&nbsp; As this change occurs, it seems natural that Computational Biologists will no longer focus on developing analysis techniques for interpreting genomic data, but may focus their efforts on one medical subfield or disease.&nbsp; It is now common for for Bioinformaticists to specialize in cancer or human metabolism or neuroscience.&nbsp; As this trend continues, it seems likely that Bioinformaticists will incorporate an increasing degree of specialization from these specific medical subfields.&nbsp; <br />
                <b>The New "Gene"</b><br />
                As an increased amount of genomic data becomes available, there will be an iterative process of genome reanalysis.&nbsp; When the first genome was sequenced 10 years ago, many of us expected to find more traits with simple inheritance patterns.&nbsp; Perhaps predictably, we were disappointed to find that very few traits could be defined by one gene, and very few definitive tests for inherited disease were possible from one genetic variant.&nbsp; The question that many people ask when presented with the possibility of sequencing their genome is "why?"&nbsp; Now, it seems a more appropriate question is, how we would best use this information, if we had our genome sequence?<br />
                Our current hypothesis for why definitive tests are so hard to find for many traits is that most traits have complex inheritance, defined by more than one genetic locus.&nbsp; If this is the case, then this is merely a problem of sequencing enough different genomes and performing an analysis that is comprehensive.&nbsp; We would predict that the end result of all this would be a series of complex algorithms, that would predict the inheritance of multiple traits, based on complex interactions between different markers throughout the genome.&nbsp; But for the end user, the result would be the same as we wanted 10 years ago: genome in, predicted phenotype out.<br />
                <b>Broader Interactions</b><br />
                Over the past decade, another trend has become more noticeable as well: translational research.&nbsp; Most researchers now recognize the importance of patenting their inventions, and it is rare to find an funded Biological study that doesn't make reference to the implications of one or more specific human disease or conditions.&nbsp; The field of whole genome sequencing is increasingly dominated by close collaborations between clinicians and researchers.&nbsp; This trend has increased, as technological advances have increased the speed and efficiency, and therefor clinical relevance, of genome sequencing.&nbsp; As this technology progresses, it seems likely that this close connection will act a as a catalyst to promote an even more dominant role for clinically relevant research in the Biological sciences.&nbsp; </div>
