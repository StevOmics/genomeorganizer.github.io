                Many people familiar with the sequencing world know that it involves the generation of huge amounts of data, much of it in the form of text files (mainly for compatibility purposes).&nbsp; One lane of sequencing on a Solexa platform can take up 10GB for raw sequence data alone, and this is often much larger, when associated analysis files are included.&nbsp; This type of data poses a special problem for the research community, since most journals have a requirement that all studied submitted for publication must include publicly accessible versions of all data included in the study.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                The NIH has the same requirement for all of the research that it funds, and up until recently, it had planned to implement a publicly accessible archiving system in order to facilitate the sharing of this data online.&nbsp; For many smaller sequencing centers, such as the one that I am running, this would have been very handy, since it would have saved us server space and bandwidth.&nbsp; This week, this plan was abruptly canned, and it has left some of us scratching our heads as to where to put the data.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                EMBO, the European equivalent to the NIH, has its own online archive (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/page.php?page=sra_submissions">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/page.php?page=sra_submissions</a>), which may present a viable alternative.&nbsp; However, I would like to use this as an opportunity to put out my invitation to private companies to propose their own solutions (I'm looking at you, Google).&nbsp; Not only do I think that a large private company, experienced in sharing large amounts of data online could benefit immensely from the advertising and public exposure that this type of service could provide, I think that it could help the public as well.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                As I have said previously, genome sequencing is rapidly becoming a ubiquitous technology.&nbsp; As more patients decide to have their genomes sequenced, it will gradually become apparent that these individuals are giving away a lot more than their nucleotide sequence when they make their genomes publicly accessible online.&nbsp; A genome contains both robust identifiers (the sequences of all commonly used fingerprinting loci), as well as predictive information about a patient's health status, which will rapidly increase as more genomes are sequenced and more predictive markers are mapped.&nbsp; These two pieces of information form an frightening combination for many people, in that once your genome is out (online or in the hands of an insurance company) it can never be un-sequenced.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Although many may argue that the best solution to this information problem is more thorough disclosure to patients and government regulation, I believe that what is really called for is an information guardian.&nbsp; My hope is that someone will form a private company, with the explicit purpose of storing, encrypting and protecting genomic data of patients, and preventing any unauthorized access.&nbsp; Such a company could protect data by running genetic tests internally, on their own servers and then supplying the results to users, such as health care providers.&nbsp; In this way, information could be limited to a need-to-know basis, preventing any unknown third party, be they medical or insurance companies, from obtaining all of the data.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                The exact makeup of this company remains to be determined.&nbsp; However, I believe that some sort of private model would provide the motivation to adapt to the latest techniques studies in use.&nbsp; The current need for a sequence repository is actually a great opportunity for this type of company to start working out the details of providing this type of data online in an efficient and secure way.&nbsp; This will lay the groundwork for future, for-profit information providing.&nbsp; By establishing such a service now, we could direct the development of this data-sharing framework, ensuring that the rights of patients and individuals do not give way to the interests of large private entities, such as insurance companies and health care providers.&nbsp; <br />
